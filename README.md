# Problem:

transcripts of some opinions from [**Scraps From The Loft**](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/)
, pre-
process and organize the data to note their similarities and differences to find various patterns.

## Perform the following data cleaning on transcripts:
i) Make text all lower case <br>
ii) Remove punctuation <br>
iii) Remove numerical values <br>
iv) Remove common non-sensical text (\n) <br>
v) Remove stop words
## Organized data in two standard text formats:
a) Corpus - corpus is a collection of texts, and they are all put together neatly in a pandas
dataframe here.<br>
b) Document-Term Matrix - word counts in matrix format
