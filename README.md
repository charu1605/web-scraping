# Problem:

transcripts of some opinions from '**Scraps From The Loft**', pre-
process and organize the data to note their similarities and differences to find various patterns.

## Perform the following data cleaning on transcripts:
i) Make text all lower case
ii) Remove punctuation
iii) Remove numerical values
iv) Remove common non-sensical text (\n)
v) Remove stop words
## Organized data in two standard text formats:
a) Corpus - corpus is a collection of texts, and they are all put together neatly in a pandas
dataframe here.
b) Document-Term Matrix - word counts in matrix format
